# TinyApp Project
## Goal


The TinyApp project is a four-day web development project using Node.js. The app replicates functionalities of popular URL shortening services like TinyURL.com and bit.ly. Users can shorten long URLs, manage their URLs, and access them via custom short links.

## Project Outcome


This project delivers a multi-page app with the following features:

User authentication for protected actions.
CRUD functionalities for URL management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Dynamic behavior based on the user's login state.
